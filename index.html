        [React | Typescript | Google Maps API] - In order to schedule tennis hitting sessions, I
        built a React weather app that displays the forecast in a calendar view.
        Most weather apps show daily forecasts, but I wanted to view hourly
        weather across seven days in one screen. I used React and Typescript for
        the frontend, and axios to call the OpenMeteo API. 
        <br><br>
        I then managed the
        state with SWR, wrote a function to split the data into hourly objects,
        and conditionally styled the ‚Äòcalendar‚Äô grid to color boxes to show
        precipitation and temperature trends.

        [React | Axios | Google Sheets API] - During the pandemic, as WA opened
        its borders, government contact tracing became overwhelmed and stopped
        reporting exposure sites. A community-led initiative began, and people
        self-reported exposure sites to a Google Spreadsheet. I addressed a real
        community need, by building a user-friendly UI in React, that extracted
        data from the spreadsheet with Google‚Äôs API. 
        <br><br>
        I displayed this data in a clean, sortable table, made it responsive on mobile, and added a
        feature to indicate the most recently added sites. In total, I reached
        20,000 views across a month, before the community data collection
        project was discontinued.
