          - [React | Google Maps API] - In order to schedule tennis hitting
          sessions, I built a React weather app that displays the forecast in a
          calendar view. Most weather apps show daily forecasts, but I wanted to
          view hourly weather across seven days in one screen. I used React with
          Typescript for the frontend, and axios to call the OpenMeteo API.
          <br /><br />
          I then managed the state with SWR, wrote a function to split the data
          into hourly objects, and conditionally styled the ‚Äòcalendar‚Äô grid to
          color boxes to show precipitation and temperature trends.

          - [React | Axios | Google Sheets API] - During the pandemic, as WA
          opened its borders, government contact tracing became overwhelmed and
          stopped reporting exposure sites. A community-led initiative began,
          and people self-reported exposure sites to a Google Spreadsheet. I
          addressed a real community need, by building a user-friendly UI in
          React, that extracted data from the spreadsheet with Google‚Äôs API.
          <br /><br />
          I displayed this data in a clean, sortable table, made it responsive
          on mobile, and added a feature to indicate the most recently added
          sites. In total, I reached 20,000 views across a month, before the
          community data collection project was discontinued.
